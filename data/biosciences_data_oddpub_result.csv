    we have provisionally named these berkeley virus and brandeis virus respectively (table 1 s2 table and s6 data).;     the survey also identified a novel totivirus and several (possibly fragmentary or non-coding) reovirus segments in cell culture at least one of which is widespread (214 datasets; figs 4 and s8 and s5 data).;     for the other nine rna viruses analysed sample sizes were smaller and dated samples were only available from a 5 year window making unconstrained estimates of mutation rate and mrca dates difficult so that quantitative estimates for these viruses should be treated with caution (results inferred using a strong prior on mutation-rate are pre- sented in s13 fig and s8 data).;     by incorporating information on host species (d. melanogaster versus d. simulans) in the phylogenetic analysis we were able detect past movement of rna viruses between these host species (e.g. fig 6) and obtain rough estimates of host switching rate [8889] (s13 fig and s8 data).;     nevertheless there appeared to be sub- stantial variation in host-switching rate amongst the seven rna viruses that were detected in both hosts with chaq virus showing the lowest rate and la jolla virus the highest (fig 6; s13 fig and s8 data).;     a similar analysis of inter-continental geographical movement suggests sub- stantial genetic structuring between geographic regions may be present in some viruses (s13 fig and s8 data) although again further time-sampled data are required for the analyses to provide useful precision.;
